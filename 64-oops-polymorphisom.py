# #polymorphism: In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. ...This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.

# ///////////////in my words///////////

# polymophism means ability to take various forms
